# Alchemical MLIP
This repository contains the code to modify machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to enable continuous and differentiable alchemical transformations.
The details of the method are described in the paper: [Interpolation and differentiation of alchemical degrees of freedom in machine learning interatomic potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10746).

> **Note:** The code is currently under final preparation and will be uploaded here shortly.
> We anticipate having the code ready by the end of this week.
> Please stay tuned for updates!
